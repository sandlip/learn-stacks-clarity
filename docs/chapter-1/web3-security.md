### Wallet Principles and Security

A wallet is your identity in Web3. It allows you to store and manage your digital assets (like tokens and NFTs), interact with dApps, and sign transactions. But unlike traditional accounts, wallets are non-custodial — you are the sole owner and custodian of your keys.

### How Wallets Are Created

When you create a wallet, a cryptographic key pair is generated:

- **Private key**: A secret string that proves ownership and allows you to sign transactions. This must be kept secure and never shared.
- **Public key**: Derived from the private key. It acts like your account number — others can use it to send you assets.

To make private keys more user-friendly, wallets generate a **mnemonic phrase** (also called a seed phrase) — a list of 12 or 24 words that can be used to recover your wallet. This phrase is the master key to your wallet.

### Wallet Types

- **Hot wallets**: Software-based wallets connected to the internet. Examples include browser extensions (like Hiro Wallet), mobile apps, or desktop apps. Convenient but more vulnerable to hacks.
- **Cold wallets**: Hardware devices or paper wallets that store your keys offline. More secure but less convenient for frequent use.

### Best Practices for Wallet Security

- Write down your seed phrase and store it in a secure, offline location.
- Never share your private key or seed phrase with anyone.
- Use hardware wallets for large or long-term holdings.
- Be cautious of phishing websites and fake wallet apps.
- Always verify URLs and avoid signing unknown transactions.

### Understanding dApps

Decentralized applications (dApps) are software programs that run on a blockchain rather than centralized servers. They use smart contracts — self-executing code stored on the blockchain — to define their logic.

Unlike traditional apps, dApps:

- Are open-source and transparent
- Cannot be shut down by a single entity
- Allow users to interact directly via wallets

Examples of dApps include:

- Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
- NFT marketplaces
- Lending and borrowing platforms
- On-chain games and social networks

## Web3 Security

### Common Wallet Risks

Web3 gives you full control — and full responsibility. Common risks include:

- **Phishing attacks**: Fake websites or apps that trick you into revealing your seed phrase.
- **Malware**: Keyloggers or clipboard hijackers that steal your private key.
- **Social engineering**: Scammers impersonating support staff or friends to gain access.

### The Security of Private Keys and Mnemonic Phrases

Your private key is the only way to access your wallet. If someone gets it, they can drain your assets. If you lose it, your assets are gone forever.

Mnemonic phrases are a human-readable backup of your private key. They must be stored securely — ideally offline, in multiple physical locations. Never store them in cloud storage or messaging apps.

### The Security Risks of Digital Signatures

When you interact with a dApp, you often need to sign a message or transaction. This proves that you authorized the action. However, signing unknown or malicious messages can expose you to:

- **Blind signing**: Approving a transaction without understanding what it does.
- **Replay attacks**: Reusing a valid signature in a different context to steal assets.

Always read what you're signing and use wallets that display clear transaction details.

### Common Fraud Tactics

- **Fake airdrops**: Promising free tokens in exchange for your private key.
- **Impersonation**: Scammers pretending to be developers or support staff.
- **Pump-and-dump schemes**: Artificially inflating token prices before dumping them.
- **Rug pulls**: Developers abandoning a project after collecting funds.

### Preventive Measures and Handling Theft

- Use reputable wallets and dApps.
- Bookmark official websites.
- Double-check contract addresses.
- If compromised, immediately transfer assets to a new wallet and notify the community.
