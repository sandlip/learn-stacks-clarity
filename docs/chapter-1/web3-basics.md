## Web3 Basics

### Web3 Overview

Web3 is the decentralized internet — a shift from platforms owned by corporations to protocols governed by communities. In Web2, companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon control user data, identity, and monetization. In Web3, users interact directly with decentralized applications (dApps) using cryptographic wallets, and data is stored on blockchains instead of private servers.

Web3 is built on three core ideas:

- **Decentralization**: No single point of control. Networks are maintained by distributed nodes.
- **Ownership**: Users own their identity, data, and digital assets.
- **Trustless systems**: Smart contracts replace intermediaries, enabling peer-to-peer interactions.

### Introduction to Blockchain Technology

A blockchain is a distributed ledger — a database that is replicated across many computers (nodes) and maintained through consensus. Each block contains a list of transactions, and blocks are cryptographically linked to form a chain. This structure ensures that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered without consensus from the network.

Key properties of blockchains:

- **Immutability**: Data cannot be changed once confirmed.
- **Transparency**: Anyone can verify the history of transactions.
- **Security**: Cryptographic algorithms protect data integrity and authenticity.

Blockchains can be public (like Bitcoin or Ethereum), private (used within organizations), or consortium-based (shared among a group of entities).
