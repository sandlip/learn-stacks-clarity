# Testing, Debugging & Tooling
Smart contracts are unforgiving. Once deployed, they cannot be patched, rolled back, or hotfixed. That’s why testing and debugging are not optional — they’re foundational. This module teaches you how to validate contract logic before deployment, simulate blockchain behaviour locally, and catch errors early using the official tooling in the Stacks ecosystem.

You’ll learn how to:
* Write unit tests that simulate real-world transactions
* Debug failed executions and inspect contract state
* Use linters and static analysis tools to enforce code quality

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to confidently test and troubleshoot Clarity contracts in isolation and in integration, ensuring that your smart contracts behave exactly as intended.
