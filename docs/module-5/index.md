# Token Standards & Asset Management
Tokens are the programmable assets of Web3. They represent value, ownership, access, and identity — and they must follow strict standards to be interoperable across wallets, contracts, and protocols. This module introduces the two formal token standards on Stacks: **SIP-010 for fungible tokens** and **SIP-009 for non-fungible tokens**, along with best practices for managing assets securely on-chain.

You’ll learn how to:
- Implement SIP-compliant tokens in Clarity
- Test token logic using Clarinet
- Enforce access control and prevent unauthorised transfers
- Design metadata and token IDs for NFTs

By the end of this module, you’ll be able to write, test, and secure token contracts that integrate cleanly with the Stacks ecosystem — from wallets to marketplaces to DAOs.
